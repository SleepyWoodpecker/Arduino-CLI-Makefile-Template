# Praying for faster Arduino compile times

1. install `arduino-cli` if you don't yet have it installed
2. run `chmod +x compile.sh` to make `compile.sh` an executable
3. run `./compile.sh <folder_name>.ino` to compile and upload the build

## TODO:

1. Check if I can use the same parent folder, but have multiple projects inside the folder
2. Support Windows shell
